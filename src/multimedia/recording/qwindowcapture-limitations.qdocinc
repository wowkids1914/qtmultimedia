    \section1 Window Capture Limitations
    The following limitations apply to using \1WindowCapture:
    \list
        \li \1WindowCapture is only supported with the FFmpeg backend.
    \endlist
    The following limitations apply when using \c QWindowCapture on X11 systems:
    \list
        \li On Linux X11 systems, when a window is moved partially outside
            the visible screen area, only the visible region is captured.
            As a result, the emitted video frames may have a size smaller
            than the window’s geometry.
        \li Windows that are outside the visible screen area cannot be captured,
            and an error signal is emitted in that case.
        \li The behavior of minimized windows or those located on an invisible
            virtual workspace depends on the window manager. For example,
            such windows can be captured on GNOME, whereas on WindowMaker or Xfwm
            such capturing is not allowed, and the window capture instance emits an error.
