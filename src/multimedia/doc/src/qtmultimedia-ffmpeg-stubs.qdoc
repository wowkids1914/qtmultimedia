\title FFmpeg stub libraries on Linux and Android
\brief This document explains the stub mechanism used for FFmpeg's dynamic dependencies on Linux
and Android platforms.

\section1 Overview

To support dynamic linking of \l{FFmpeg} in compliance with the LGPL license, Qt Multimedia uses
\b{stub libraries} to handle optional external dependencies on Linux and Android platforms.

On these platforms, FFmpeg may require additional shared libraries that are not shipped with Qt:

\list
    \li \b{OpenSSL} - required for secure network streaming.
    \li \b{VAAPI} (Linux only) - enables hardware-accelerated video decoding and encoding.
\endlist

These libraries are often not available or cannot be bundled due to licensing constraints. To ensure
FFmpeg-based features remain functional (excluding the unsupported parts), Qt delivers
\e{stub libraries} as fallbacks.

\section1 Why Stubs Are Needed

If these dependencies are not present at runtime, FFmpeg will fail to load or function properly.
The stub mechanism allows:

\list
    \li Successful loading of FFmpeg even when OpenSSL or VAAPI are missing.
    \li Graceful degradation of functionality (e.g., lack of VAAPI results in no hardware
        acceleration, but playback still works).
    \li Users to \b{opt-in} to using their own system-provided versions of these libraries if available.
\endlist

\section1 What Stubs Are

Stub libraries mimic the interfaces of the real libraries (e.g., \c{libssl.so}, \c{libva.so}) but
do not implement full functionality. Instead, they:

\list
    \li Provide dummy implementations that return safe fallback values or no-ops.
    \li Dynamically attempt to resolve real symbols via \c{QLibrary::load} / \c{QLibrary::resolve}.
    \li Fail gracefully if real libraries are not found.
\endlist

Qt ships these stubs under the names:

\list
    \li \c{libQt6FFmpegStub-ssl.so.x}
    \li \c{libQt6FFmpegStub-crypto.so.x}
    \li \c{libQt6FFmpegStub-va.so.x}
    \li \c{libQt6FFmpegStub-va-drm.so.x}
    \li \c{libQt6FFmpegStub-va-x11.so.x}
    \li (more may be added in the future)
\endlist

\section1 How Stubs Work in Qt

When FFmpeg is dynamically linked:

\list
    \li It normally expects to be linked against system libraries like \c{libssl.so.3} or \c{libva.so.2}.
    \li Qt patches the FFmpeg binaries using the \c{patchelf} tool to replace these real
        dependencies with stub equivalents.
\endlist

Example:

\badcode
    # Original linkage
    libffmpegmediaplugin.so: needs libavcodec.so (depends on the FFmpeg libs)
    libavcodec.so: needs libssl.so.3

    # After patching
    libffmpegmediaplugin.so: needs libavcodec.so (no changes)
    libavcodec.so: needs libQt6FFmpegStub-ssl.so.3
    libQt6FFmpegStub-ssl.so.3: optionally needs libssl.so.3 (no explicit linkage)
\endcode

This patching is performed automatically as part of the build/distribution process.

\section1 Runtime Behavior and Security Notes

\list
    \li FFmpeg plugins are loaded with \c{dlopen(..., RTLD_LOCAL)}, so stub symbols do not leak into
        the global symbol table.
    \li If the application already uses OpenSSL or VAAPI, the system libraries may be picked up from
        the global scope and must be binary compatible.
    \li The shipped QtMultimedia and FFmpeg binaries are compatible with:
        \list
            \li \b{OpenSSL 3.x.x} (with symbol versioning \c{@OPENSSL_3.0.0})
            \li \b{VAAPI ABI 0.33} (older ABI 0.32 is explicitly unsupported)
        \endlist
    \li It is also possible to build Qt Multimedia against \b{OpenSSL 1.x.x}, though compatibility
        depends on your FFmpeg configuration.
\endlist

To completely remove the use of stub libraries, there are two options:

\list
    \li Use \c{patchelf} to restore FFmpeg's dependencies back to the system libraries (e.g., replace
        \c{libQt6FFmpegStub-ssl.so.3} with \c{libssl.so.3}). This must be done for all FFmpeg libraries:
        \c{libavcodec}, \c{libavformat}, \c{libavutil}, \c{libswresample}, and \c{libswscale}.
    \li Replace the shipped FFmpeg libraries with ones built manually by the user.
        See \l{Building FFmpeg from source}.
\endlist
